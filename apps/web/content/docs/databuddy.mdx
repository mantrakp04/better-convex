# Databuddy Integration

This template includes optional integration with [Databuddy](https://databuddy.cc), a privacy-friendly analytics service.

## Overview

Databuddy provides lightweight, privacy-focused analytics without cookies or personal data collection. It's pre-configured in this template and activates automatically when you provide a client ID.

## Setup

### 1. Create a Databuddy Account

Sign up at [databuddy.cc](https://databuddy.cc) and create a new project to get your client ID.

### 2. Add Environment Variable

Add your Databuddy client ID to your environment:

```bash
# apps/web/.env.local
VITE_DATA_BUDDY_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
```

That's it. The analytics script loads automatically when the environment variable is set.

## How It Works

The integration is handled in the root route configuration:

```typescript
// routes/__root.tsx
scripts: [
  {
    ...(env.VITE_DATA_BUDDY_CLIENT_ID ? {
      src: "https://cdn.databuddy.cc/databuddy.js",
      "data-client-id": env.VITE_DATA_BUDDY_CLIENT_ID,
      crossOrigin: "anonymous",
      async: true,
    } : {}),
  }
]
```

Key features of this implementation:

- **Conditional loading**: Script only loads when `VITE_DATA_BUDDY_CLIENT_ID` is set
- **Async loading**: Doesn't block page rendering
- **Zero configuration**: No additional setup needed in your components

## Production Deployment

Set the environment variable in your hosting platform:

**Vercel:**
```bash
vercel env add VITE_DATA_BUDDY_CLIENT_ID production
```

**Netlify:**
```bash
netlify env:set VITE_DATA_BUDDY_CLIENT_ID "your-client-id"
```

**Convex** (if accessing from backend):
```bash
bunx convex env set DATA_BUDDY_CLIENT_ID "your-client-id"
```

## Disabling Analytics

To disable Databuddy analytics, simply remove or unset the `VITE_DATA_BUDDY_CLIENT_ID` environment variable. The script won't load without it.

## Privacy Considerations

Databuddy is designed to be privacy-friendly:

- No cookies required
- No personal data collection
- GDPR compliant by default
- Lightweight script (~1KB)

This makes it suitable for applications where user privacy is a priority and you want to avoid cookie consent banners.
