# Environment Setup

This template requires several environment variables for Convex, authentication, and other services.

## Environment Files

Create environment files in the appropriate locations:

```bash
# For the web app
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env.local

# For the backend (if applicable)
cp packages/backend/.env.example packages/backend/.env.local
```

## Required Variables

### Convex Configuration

```bash
# Your Convex deployment URL (from convex.dev dashboard)
CONVEX_URL=https://your-deployment.convex.cloud

# Convex deploy key (for production deployments)
CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY=prod:your-deploy-key
```

### Better Auth Configuration

```bash
# Base URL of your application
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Secret key for signing tokens (generate a secure random string)
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key-min-32-characters
```

Generate a secure secret:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

### OAuth Providers (Optional)

#### GitHub

```bash
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your-github-client-id
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your-github-client-secret
```

#### Google

```bash
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
```

#### Discord

```bash
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your-discord-client-id
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=your-discord-client-secret
```

## Convex Environment Variables

Set environment variables in your Convex deployment:

```bash
# Set a single variable
bunx convex env set BETTER_AUTH_SECRET your-secret

# Set multiple variables
bunx convex env set GITHUB_CLIENT_ID your-id
bunx convex env set GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET your-secret
```

View current environment variables:

```bash
bunx convex env list
```

## Development vs Production

### Development

In development, variables are loaded from `.env.local` files:

```bash
# apps/web/.env.local
CONVEX_URL=https://your-dev-deployment.convex.cloud
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Production

In production, set variables through your hosting platform:

- **Vercel**: Project Settings → Environment Variables
- **Netlify**: Site Settings → Environment Variables
- **Railway**: Variables tab in your service

## Security Best Practices

<Callout type="warning">
Never commit `.env.local` files or expose secrets in client-side code.
</Callout>

### Do

- Use `.env.example` as a template (without real values)
- Set production secrets through your hosting dashboard
- Use different secrets for development and production
- Rotate secrets periodically

### Don't

- Commit `.env.local` to version control
- Prefix secrets with `VITE_` or `NEXT_PUBLIC_` (exposes to client)
- Share secrets in chat or documentation
- Reuse secrets across projects

## Validation

The template validates required environment variables on startup. If a variable is missing, you'll see a clear error message indicating which variable needs to be set.

## Next Steps

With your environment configured, you're ready to start development. Head to the [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/introduction) guide to begin building.
