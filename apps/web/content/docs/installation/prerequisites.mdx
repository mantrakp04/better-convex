# Prerequisites

Before getting started with this template, ensure you have the following installed and configured.

## Required Software

### Node.js

Node.js 18+ is required. We recommend using a version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm).

```bash
# Check your Node version
node --version
```

### Bun (Recommended)

This template uses Bun as the package manager for faster installs and better monorepo support.

```bash
# Install Bun
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# Verify installation
bun --version
```

### Git

Git is required for version control and cloning the template.

```bash
git --version
```

## Accounts Required

### Convex Account

You'll need a free Convex account to deploy your backend.

1. Sign up at [convex.dev](https://convex.dev)
