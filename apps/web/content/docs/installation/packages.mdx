description: Installing dependencies and setting up the monorepo
---

# Package Installation

This template uses a Turborepo monorepo structure with multiple packages and apps.

## Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone the template
git clone https://github.com/your-org/better-convex.git

# Navigate to the project
cd better-convex
```

## Install Dependencies

Install all dependencies across the monorepo:

```bash
bun install
```

This installs dependencies for:
- `apps/web` - The main web application
- `packages/backend` - Convex backend functions
- `packages/ui` - Shared UI components
- Root workspace tooling

## Package Overview

### Core Dependencies

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `convex` | Convex client and runtime |
| `convex-ents` | Entity relationships and type-safe edges |
| `@convex-dev/aggregate` | Real-time aggregations |
| `better-auth` | Authentication framework |

### Frontend Dependencies

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `@tanstack/react-query` | Data fetching and caching |
| `@convex-dev/react-query` | Convex + React Query integration |
| `@tanstack/start` | Full-stack React framework |

### Development Dependencies

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `typescript` | Type checking |
| `eslint` | Code linting |
| `prettier` | Code formatting |
| `turbo` | Monorepo build system |

## Verify Installation

Run the development server to verify everything installed correctly:

```bash
bun dev
```

You should see output from both the web app and Convex dev server.

## Troubleshooting

### Peer Dependency Warnings

Bun may show peer dependency warnings. These are typically safe to ignore as the monorepo structure resolves them correctly.

### Node Version Mismatch

If you see engine compatibility errors:

```bash
# Use the correct Node version
nvm use 18

# Or with fnm
fnm use 18
```

### Convex CLI Issues

If Convex commands fail, ensure you have the latest version:

```bash
bun add -g convex
```

## Next Steps

After installing packages, configure your [environment variables](/docs/installation/environment).
