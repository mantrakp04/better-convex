# Setup

This guide walks you through setting up the template for local development.

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) (v1.0+)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (v18+)
- A [Convex](https://convex.dev) account

## Installation

### 1. Clone and Install Dependencies

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd better-convex
bun install
```

### 2. Set Up Convex

Initialize Convex and start the development server:

```bash
bunx convex dev
```

This command will:
1. Prompt you to log in to Convex (if not already)
2. Create a new project or connect to an existing one
3. Deploy your schema and functions
4. Start watching for changes

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in `apps/web`:

```bash
VITE_CONVEX_URL=https://<your-project>.convex.cloud
VITE_CONVEX_SITE_URL=https://<your-project>.convex.site
VITE_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

You can find your Convex URLs in the [Convex dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev).

### 4. Set Up Better Auth JWKS

Generate and set the JWKS for Better Auth:

```bash
# The JWKS is generated when you first run auth
# Set it in your Convex environment
bunx convex env set JWKS '<your-jwks-value>'
```

### 5. Start the Development Server

```bash
bun dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3001`.

## Project Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `bun dev` | Start all packages in development mode |
| `bun dev --filter web` | Start only the web app |
| `bunx convex dev` | Start Convex development server |
| `bunx convex deploy` | Deploy to production |
| `bunx tsc --noEmit` | Type-check without emitting |

## Troubleshooting

### Convex Functions Not Updating

If your Convex functions aren't updating, ensure `convex dev` is running in a separate terminal.

### Type Errors After Schema Changes

After modifying the schema, regenerate types:

```bash
bunx convex dev
```

This automatically updates the generated types in `convex/_generated/`.

### Authentication Issues

1. Verify JWKS is set: `bunx convex env get JWKS`
2. Check that `VITE_CONVEX_SITE_URL` matches your Convex site URL
3. Ensure cookies are enabled in your browser
